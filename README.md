## Trie definition

**Trie**[1] is an ordered tree data structure that uses strings as keys. It's an efficient information retrieval data structure that we can use to search a word in **O(M)** time, where **M** is maximum string length. However the penalty is on trie storage requirements.
A common application of a **trie** is storing a **predictive text** or **autocomplete dictionary**, such as found on a mobile telephone.
Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries.

The following picture shows a trie with the keys "Joe", "John", "Johnny", "Johnny", "Jane", and "Jack"

## Levenshtein distance definition

The **Levenshtein distance**[5] is a string metric for measuring the difference between two words. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

## Mixing Trie and the Levenshtein distance in order to calculate String Similarity Faster
In the **Iterative with full matrix** version of Levenshtein distance[5] we can avoid a lot of work if we can process the words in order, so we never need to repeat a row for the same prefix of letters[4]. The trie data structure is perfect for this. 

If I have a trie with the words "Joe", "John", "Johnny", "Johnny", "Jane", and "Jack" the following table shows the resulting matrix containing words that are less than the given maximum distance (equal to 2) from the target word "Jane":

| | |J|a|n|e|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| |0|1|2|3|4|
|J|1|0|1|2|3|
|a|2|1|0|1|2|
|c|3|2|1|1|2|
|**k(*)**|**4**|**3**|**2**|**2**|**2**|
|n|3|2|1|0|1|
|**e(*)**|**4**|**3**|**2**|**1**|**0**|
|o|2|1|1|2|3|
|**e(*)**|**3**|**2**|**2**|**2**|**2**|
|h|3|2|2|2|3|
|n(*)|4|3|3|2|2|
|n|5|4|4|3|3|
|y(*)|5|4|4|3|4|

Each right element of the array contains the distance.

## Performance

The tests have been carried out on a Laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz, 8GB RAM).
I've added **483.805 distinct words** into Trie and I've performed the following tests using the word "rap":

|Operation|Time (milliseconds)|Results|
|----|----|----|
|Loading words into Trie|970|483.805 words loaded|
|Count words starts with prefix 'rap'|0,03|147|
|Get words starts with prefix 'rap'|1,69| a List containing 147 words|
|String Similarity (Maximum Distance 1) from word 'rap'|22,98| a Map containing 48 similar words|
|Remove word rap|0,04| |

## Complexity
Average:
|Access|Search|Insertion|Deletion|String Similarity|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|O(k)|O(k)|O(k)|O(k)|O(k*n)|

where **k** is maximum string length and **n** is number of nodes in the trie

## Use Case

### Dictionary Suggestions OR Autocomplete dictionary

Retrieving data stored in Trie data structure is very fast, so it is most suited for application where retrieval are more frequently performed like Phone directory where contact searching operation is used frequently [1-3].

### Searching Contact from Mobile Contact list OR Phone Directory

Auto suggestion of words while searching for anything in dictionary is very common [2-3].
If we search for word "tiny", then it auto suggest words starting with same characters like "tine", "tin", "tinny" etc.

### String Similarity 

Trie can be used to Fast and Easy calculate Levenshtein distance [4].

## Example of usage

With this implementation you can perform the follows operations:

- **Add** a word.
- **Remove** a word.
- **Check** if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given **prefix**.
- **Check** if a word is in the trie.
- **Count words starts with a partial name** to search the application for.
- **Get words starts with a partial name** to search the application for.
- **Show** the Trie
- Calculate **string similarity** using Levenshtein distance.

``` java

import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// This is a case sensitive trie
		Trie trie = new Trie(true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

		// Add words.
		trie.add("Joe");
		trie.add("John");
		trie.add("Johny");
		trie.add("Johnny");
		trie.add("Jane");
		trie.add("Jack");
		
		System.out.println("Number Of Words: " + trie.getNumberOfWords());

		trie.show();
		
		// Return true if the word is in the trie.
		System.out.println(trie.search("Jane"));
		// Return true if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.
		System.out.println(trie.startsWith("Ja"));
		// Remove a word
		trie.remove("Johnny");

		// Count words starts with a partial name to search the application for
		System.out.println("Number Of Words Starts with 'John': " + trie.countWordStartsWith("John"));
		System.out.println("Number Of Words Starts with 'Ja': " + trie.countWordStartsWith("Ja"));
		// Get words starts with a partial name to search the application for
		Stream<String> words = trie.getWordStartsWith("Jo");
		words.forEach(System.out::println);
		
		// String Similarity using Levenshtein distance		
		// Get words that are less than the given maximum distance from the target word
		for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : trie.getSimilarityMap("Jane", 1).entrySet()) {
			System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " - " + entry.getValue());
		}
		// Get word that is less than the given maximum distance from the target word
		System.out.println(trie.similarity("Jane", 1));
	}
}
```
