**Trie** is an efficient information retrieval data structure that we can use to search a word in **O(M)** time, where **M** is maximum string length. However the penalty is on trie storage requirements.

The following picture shows a trie with the keys "A","to", "tea", "ted", "ten", "i", "in", and "inn"

A common application of a **trie** is storing a **predictive text** or **autocomplete dictionary**, such as found on a mobile telephone. Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries.
